Some common reasons for this error include:\n\nComplex or inefficient code that requires excessive processing time.\nInfinite loops or recursive functions that never terminate.\nProcessing large amounts of data without proper optimization.\nMaking external requests to slow or unresponsive servers.\nTo fix this error, you can try the following solutions:\n\nOptimize your code to make it more efficient and reduce execution time.\nBreak down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to prevent timeouts.\nIncrease the maximum execution time limit in the PHP configuration file (php.ini) using the \"max_execution_time\" directive.\nUse set_time_limit() function in your PHP script to temporarily extend the execution time limit.\nImplement caching mechanisms to reduce the need for repeated processing.\nIdentify and eliminate any infinite loops or recursive functions causing the script to hang indefinitely.\nConsider using asynchronous processing or background tasks for long-running operations.","questionInactiveTime":14.535,"answerTime":24.538}]}
